Welcome to my little piece of paradise on Harvey Lake. My name is Rob Swan and I’m happy to share my place here on the water with you. Born and raised here is Harvey, I was very happy to move back here and call Harvey my home once again. I work full time but I am happy to share the lake experience with you because I feel that if you sit on my deck on a nice quiet morning, the ducks swimming by, maybe one of my neighbours in their kayak, it gives you piece of mind and changes you in a good way. When not working you will find me curling around the world through, Curling Across the Nation. This has allowed me to visit places around the world I never thought I would and that’s what my place on the lake offers you, a chance to get away. One step off my deck and you are in the lake, unlike other places on the lake that offer “lake access” that forces you to walk through someone’s yard or deck to get into the lake. So do not settle for less when booking your getaway. Harvey lake offer a great fishing experience, kayaking, swimming, leisure boating, and in the village(a short 10 minute drive) you’ll find a gas station, a pizza shop, several local restaurants, several local country stores, a liquor outlet, and so much more to serve your needs during your stay. My house offer sat TV, wireless, washer/dryer, dishwasher, bbq, lawn chairs, so everything you need for a great experience at the lake. For more information, just ask.

I'm 68, a mom of two, (our daughter lives nearby and our son is in Montreal with his lovely British wife, Rosie) and  ""NanNan"" of 2, of course beautiful grandchildren.  I've been with my partner for 46 years,  love yoga, meditating, vegan lifestyle, the beach, exercising, tai chi, walking, especially in nature, Qi gong, reading, biking and travelling.  And on that list should be the love my 4 legged fur family as well, from guinea pigs to rabbits to Theodore, Teddy, our pot bellied pig, to a tamed ""wild"" Starling, (who would sit on the backs of one of our dogs when out walking) to all our dogs and cats over the years.  I grew up with a spider monkey in the 60's (he came from Florida).  Mickey, would wear diapers we would make out of towels and I, as a teenager, would dress him up. We would take him out to stores and he would hold our hands and just walk beside us.  A very good boy!!!! He loved TV and breakfast was his favorite, sitting with us at the table eating his favorite-toast with jam and orange juice, like he was another sibling!!

Have worked as a medical secretary, civil engineering technologist, fitness trainer, yoga instructor and in nursing.  But that part of my life is secondary to the love of my family. That is my legacy! we tavelled for several years until the g'babies came along and now can't be too far from them.  

Have used AirBNB personally and loved each home/apt we entered.  Now we are moving closer to take care of our g'babies, but can't let go of our beach house, so we decided to open our home to other beach lovers!! YOU!! Enjoy!!!!

I am Irish, originally from the Beautiful City of  Dublin. 

I love to play music, sing, write and record music at home,  with the occasional live performance.  

I currently live between London UK and Canada. I have also lived in Scotland, France, Argentina, and Brazil. 

I am an avid traveller and do so about 3/4 times a year. My favourite cities right now are Istanbul, Barcelona and Buenos Aires. 
Cities are really my thing, the buzz, the people, the aromas, the food, the architecture.

I am pretty laid back and easy going and get along with most people easily. 
I'm also old enough to be responsible, but still love to let myself go and enjoy good, food, drinks, and have a laugh with friends, both old and new.

Other things i enjoy.
Stand Up Comedy, Museums, Theatre, Concerts and all sorts of live performance. I also love to watch movies, particularly foreign language, drama, suspense and thrillers. 

But enough about me, what's you story?

I make myself available to recommend local experiences and to enhance your stay however possible. I can also leave you your space and allow you to soak up the good times!

My work takes me across the world and I therefore have great contacts all over. With my extensive online experiences, I've decided to start renting out my properties and those of other people that are looking to make their property become an income generator.

If i'm staying at your place, rest assured that I will treat like my own and leave it cleaner than when I arrived. I usually do the turnover as that is what I would wish for. ;)

As a host or property manager, I make sure your stay is comfortable, enjoyable and memorable. 

I look forward to hosting you and making you feel at home. 

I speak English, French and Spanish and I am available for any questions at all times.

I've traveled through five countries using only Airbnb and I've been an active AirBNB host for three years and love it. 

As a host, it's important to me that your experience is a personal one. I try to make sure that the space is set up in a way that you feel like it's yours.
