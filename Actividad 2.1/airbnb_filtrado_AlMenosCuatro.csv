The best way to describe myself is an eccentric world traveler, documentarian, humanitarian, alchemist, explorer who is in search for the truth and not a slave to the illusion of the system. I'm an open-minded and friendly guy who has been traveling the world for the past 26 years through 168 countries on 6 continents, from the roof of Africa on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, through the jungles of south-east Asia to the southern tip of Patagonia on Tierra del Fuego. This lifestyle has allowed me to share the love of many cultures, religions and races around the world. Always in motion to explore the splendors of our planet with a never-ending, ever-changing magnificent views and realities. I started my journey in 1988 and haven't looked back to the illusion. I am attracted to adventure, nature, cultural diversity, history, architecture, wildlife, anthropology and unique customs. My motivation for this choice of lifestyle is to experience, learn and meet as many people while witnessing as many traditional activities as I can during my life time. At the same time, my true passion is my humanitarian work supporting people in third world countries with education, water, food, medicine, business creation, life necessities and love. My main goal is to create a bridge from the developed world to the impoverished people of the world, creating equality and opportunity. Being a citizen of the world gives you the feeling of being connected to the entire planet and having a real understanding of the people who live on it makes you feel so appreciative to be alive and thankful to be apart of it. It makes you realize the whole world is our home and we are all family in it. This is why I am opening up my home to other travelers to stay while expanding my international network of friends. If you really want to know who I am and what I do, check out my documentaries on my Youtube channel at SELIM FEHMI OZCAN or my photos on my private website at True MyEyes.

I’m a “military brat” who lived and travelled all over the world growing up.  Many of my summers were spent on the Mighty Miramichi, where my mom and generations before her were born.  I loved spending time with my Grandparents here, and have many fond memories of these New Brunswick summers. 
My Uncle and Aunt recently moved back to the Miramichi and ventured into the vacation rental business.  They opened up Cast Away Vacation rentals in May of 2020 and have thoroughly enjoyed helping guests create special and memorable vacations on the beautiful Miramichi River.
My husband Mike and I (with our three children) have decided to jump on board with the intent to carry on creating these exciting experiences for guests at the Lodge and at our newest property the Grand Lodge. 
We are pleased and proud to be assuming the reins of Cast Away Vacation Rentals in September of 2022.  We look forward to hosting you, your family and friends very soon!!!

My husband, myself & our 3 sons are undertaking a dream come true! 
We've worked incredibly hard to build this cabin (ourselves) for others to enjoy - and maybe ourselves once in awhile!

We want to share our way of living with as many as we can! We live simply and are self sufficient- raising our own beef and chickens, we have hens for eggs and large gardens, preserving it all. We are very outdoors related and our every day life is not like most!  

I enjoy being a stay at home mom, love taking photos, and hunting for a great antique bargain! 

My husband and sons love hunting, wheeling, and the outdoors of any kind!

As a family we enjoy hiking to local waterfalls, making maple syrup at the family sugar shack, fishing, and hunting for wild mushrooms.

We originally bought our cottage to renovate for my parents to live in but plans quickly changed as we were recently blessed with another sweet boy. 

We are big travel and outdoor enthusiasts and try to discover new places often and like to think of ourselves as savvy travellers. 

We are trying to bring up our children to value experiences over ""things"" and have discovered what we can't live without (besides my family itself) being by the water, sunsets and sunshine. 

We know very well what it's like to be a traveller so we will try to be as accommodating as possible with our guests. We have strong roots in the Maritimes and have lived in multiple cities so please don't hesitate to ask for recommendations!

I look forward to hosting you and making you feel at home and am available for any questions at all times.

I would also like to welcome you to New Brunswick, to our beautiful slice of Paradise :)

I loved spending time with my Grandparents here, and have many fond memories of these New Brunswick summers. 
My Uncle and Aunt recently moved back to the Miramichi and ventured into the vacation rental business.  They opened up Cast Away Vacation rentals in May of 2020 and have thoroughly enjoyed helping guests create special and memorable vacations on the beautiful Miramichi River.
My husband Mike and I (with our three children) have decided to jump on board with the intent to carry on creating these exciting experiences for guests at the Lodge and at our newest property the Grand Lodge.

While living in Arizona my husband and I decided to build a home on the island so we could enjoy island summers and escape the desert heat.  My dad was up for the challenge and he built our home in 2007.  We decided to share our adorable little cottage in 2015 and became super hosts with Air B&B for 4 years.  During Covid I deleted our account so here we are, starting from scratch with Air B&B.  We hope you enjoy our home and the serenity of the island as much as we do.

'Our neighbourhood faces the ocean, is abutted by a small fortress from the War of 1812, and is skirted by a freight line railway, whose trains chug through occasionally and which features a pathway that stretches from just above Bayshore Beach to McLaren's Beach, along bountiful flora and incredible rock formations.   Further down the street is a small graveyard whose earliest interments go back to the 1800s.  On the far reaches of the neighbourhood are the remains of Fort Dufferin.   The area is often foggy and can be quite windy due to its proximity to the ocean, but is nonetheless beautiful - especially on starry nights where you can see almost forever.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-1231387344739883001/original/ffb86254-f8ea-476d-9a2d-718f71d5ebd3.jpeg,598263982,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/598263982,Buffie,2024-08-25,,,within an hour,100%,83%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User/original/2158b26e-0879-4abd-af6c-ca88ae4ff052.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User/original/2158b26e-0879-4abd-af6c-ca88ae4ff052.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,1,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,Neighborhood highlights,City of Saint John,Saint John,45.25059,-66.07633,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,6,1.0,1 bath,3.0,4.0,"[""LG refrigerator"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Self check-in"", ""Heating - split type ductless system"", ""Kitchen"", ""Bay view"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Shared beach access"", ""Wifi"", ""Hot water"", ""Free dryer \u2013 In unit"", ""Hangers"", ""Essentials"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Dining table"", ""Bathtub"", ""Washer"", ""Freezer"", ""Board games"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""LG stainless steel single oven"", ""Iron"", ""Clothing storage"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Ceiling fan"", ""Toaster"", ""Fire pit"", ""Radiant heating"", ""LG stainless steel electric stove"", ""Free street parking"", ""Bed linens"", ""Coffee maker: drip coffee maker, Keurig coffee machine"", ""Children\u2019s dinnerware"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Books and reading material"", ""Ocean view"", ""Exterior security cameras on property"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""TV"", ""Microwave"", ""Coffee"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Keypad"", ""First aid kit"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Baking sheet""]",$111.00,1,30,1,1,1125,1125,1.0,1125.0,,t,30,60,90,365,2024-12-29,3,3,0,2024-09-04,2024-10-25,4.67,5.0,4.33,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,t,1,1,0,0,0.77
