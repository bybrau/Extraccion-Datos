In addition to running B&Bs for over 16 years, Dwight was a transit operator for 35 years while Barbara was in management and fund development for the arts and in publishing. More recently, in their semi-retirement, Dwight & Barbara worked together as Floating Managers for luxury retirement communities  throughout Canada and the USA. This work presented a wonderful opportunity to experience different parts of the country while enjoying the friendship, wisdom and perspective of countless seniors. It also got us hooked on a pared down lifestyle that allows for a variety of adventures. We love the magic of meeting so many different people along the journey!

Our interests include getting out in nature ... boating, sculling, kayaking, fishing and snapping photos.

I am Irish, originally from the Beautiful City of  Dublin. 

I love to play music, sing, write and record music at home,  with the occasional live performance.  

I currently live between London UK and Canada. I have also lived in Scotland, France, Argentina, and Brazil. 

I am an avid traveller and do so about 3/4 times a year. My favourite cities right now are Istanbul, Barcelona and Buenos Aires. 
Cities are really my thing, the buzz, the people, the aromas, the food, the architecture.

I am pretty laid back and easy going and get along with most people easily. 
I'm also old enough to be responsible, but still love to let myself go and enjoy good, food, drinks, and have a laugh with friends, both old and new.

Other things i enjoy.
Stand Up Comedy, Museums, Theatre, Concerts and all sorts of live performance. I also love to watch movies, particularly foreign language, drama, suspense and thrillers. 

But enough about me, what's you story?

Whether I'm traveling myself or making it possible for people to stay in my community it's all so important. When you travel you want to experience a place like a local...or at least I do. So for me, Airbnb is how it makes sense. 

I've traveled through five countries using only Airbnb and I've been an active AirBNB host for three years and love it. 

As a host, it's important to me that your experience is a personal one. I try to make sure that the space is set up in a way that you feel like it's yours. That you see and live a glimpse of what it's like to live in that community.

Whether I'm traveling myself or making it possible for people to stay in my community it's all so important. When you travel you want to experience a place like a local...or at least I do. So for me, Airbnb is how it makes sense. 

I've traveled through five countries using only Airbnb and I've been an active AirBNB host for three years and love it.

Whether I'm traveling myself or making it possible for people to stay in my community it's all so important. When you travel you want to experience a place like a local...or at least I do. So for me, Airbnb is how it makes sense. 

I've traveled through five countries using only Airbnb and I've been an active AirBNB host for three years and love it. 

As a host, it's important to me that your experience is a personal one. I try to make sure that the space is set up in a way that you feel like it's yours. That you see and live a glimpse of what it's like to live in that community.
